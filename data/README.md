# Pipeline

I chose 656 H3N2 viruses that largely overlap with the [flux](https://github.com/trvrb/flux) analysis.
These viruses were selected from the full set of strains from both IRD and GISAID, preferring strains with more HI data, longer sequences and precise dates.
I selected at most 50 strains per year from 1968 to 2011.
Nucleotide sequences are 1715 bases and amino acid sequences are 566 residues.
I matched HI data to these strains, giving 13,980 titers and 536 serum samples.
Only sera that were tested against 5 or more different viruses were kept.

Epitopes sites were determined following Munoz and Deem 2005 (["Epitope analysis for influenza vaccine design"](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X0400636X)).
In this case, we have 437 non-epitope residues and 129 epitope residues.
